# bcvin Fieldwork Log, May 2020

# 4 May 2020
# - Met with Pat Bowen and Carl Bogdanoff to discuss sampling and vineyard etiquette.
# - We should be allowed to leave up tape throughout the season and mark buds with metal tags but should ask first, of course
# - May be allowed to tag vines until next year for easy finding - ask managers
# - Pat and Carl don't think Arterra or Quail's Gate are doing organics management. Sebastian Farms is all organic now.
# - Merlot or Chardonnay would be good varieties to sample more throughly because they are commonly grown and popular for the region. Also, possibly Pinot gris
# - Slope aspect, east vs west side of lake (getting morning or afternoon sun), row direction

# Need to consider:
# Make sure vines we choose will be there for 3 years
#
# TO DO:
# Make "how to get where document" add links to Carl's maps on github
# Seb Farms names - first 2 letters = variety, 3rd letter = block? Add block for each variety to the variety names document for Carl
