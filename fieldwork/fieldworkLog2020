# bcvin Fieldwork Log, May 2020

# 4 May 2020
# - Met with Pat Bowen and Carl Bogdanoff to discuss sampling and vineyard etiquette.
# - We should be allowed to leave up tape throughout the season and mark buds with metal tags but should ask first, of course
# - May be allowed to tag vines until next year for easy finding - ask managers
# - Pat and Carl don't think Arterra or Quail's Gate are doing organics management. Sebastian Farms is all organic now.
# - Merlot or Chardonnay would be good varieties to sample more throughly because they are commonly grown and popular for the region. Also, possibly Pinot gris
# - Slope aspect, east vs west side of lake (getting morning or afternoon sun), row direction
# - the vineyard managers we are meeting should be considered more collaborators than facilitators. They might have good ideas.
# - to keep vine quality consistent, we should focus on vineyards directly managed by the big wine companies rather than contract growers. This is because contract growers get paid based on the amount of grapes they sell, rather than the quality of the grapes, so there is a tendency to overcrop. Mike may suggest a contract grower though that is growing to the higher standards, and if so we should go with his suggestion. As long as we keep to high quality vine management, the wine company should not make a big difference.
# - the most popular grape varieties shifts regularly. At the moment there is a lot of shifting to merlot from white winegrapes in the south. How it is probably 70:30 ratio of red to white there. More centrally in the valley it is more like 50:50. Sav blanc is getting more popular, and pinot gris is also popular at the moment  
# - vines should be at least 4 years old for us to monitor them   

# - Grower communication 
# --- send growers information in easily digestible and usable formats i.e. simple spreadsheets or maps
# --- make yourself useful by giving growers information that they want
# --- Try never to say no to a talk or committee meeting invitation
# --- Get on the Research and Development Council for BC Wine. Maybe attend conference if there is one.
# --- when writing grants, deliverables must be useful.  
# Need to consider:
# Make sure vines we choose will be there for 3 years

# - We also briefly discussed winter hardiness modeling. 
# --- Carl has started using a 4th order Quadratic equation, and this seems to be working well
# --- acclimation and deacclimation are not the same process, but Carl thinks they should have similar rates 
# --- Carl also doesn't think there should be a relationship between maximum hardiness and rate of deacclimation. He pointed out Riesling bursts quite late, whereas Chardonnay bursts early, but they are both fairly hardy 
#
# TO DO:
# Make "how to get where document" add links to Carl's maps on github
# Seb Farms names - first 2 letters = variety, 3rd letter = block? Add block for each variety to the variety names document for Carl
