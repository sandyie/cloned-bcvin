Dear Mr Reiner,

My name is Lizzie, and I am a professor at UBC studying winegrapes and climate change (insert link here). Two members of my team, Faith and Mira, where out sampling Quail's Gate's Mannhardt Vineyard last week, and met your daughter Ines. They were pleased to hear about the early days of the vineyard. While chatting, the subject of historical data came up. My work mainly focuses on understanding winegrape phenology with regards to climate, so at the moment I have people out surveying phenology at various sites in the Okenagan Valley. I am also very interested in any historical data that might have been collected in the past because it helps us plan for future changes in climate. Ines said you used to collect temperature data when you managed the Mannhardt site, and that we should ask if you still have it and if you would be willing to share it. I was also wondering if you might have collected any phenology data during this time?

Please let me know if you would like more information about the project I am working on, and if you think you might have data we could use.
