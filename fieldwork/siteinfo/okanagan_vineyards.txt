Site info misc for Okanakan vineyards 

From Pat Bowen on 20 April 2020:

Re your message earlier on Arterra vineyards, all of their vineyards should be good for you, but if you need to pare down, I would certainly keep Dark Horse, because Mike's office is there and we have a weather station on site. Whitetail is bigger, a cooler site, and the higher elevation area is even cooler. They've had some winter freeze issues there in the past. McIntyre is similar to Whitetail. Inkameep is a great site, older vineyard. They should all be OK.

Your plan looks good.  When contacting Mission Hill vineyards you should always cc Rob Achurch (I think he is the head vineyard manager for all of Mission Hill).  You may however want to contact Devin regarding a protocol for visiting/working in any of their vineyards.  Regardless, Rob & Devin work closely together and my understanding is Devin looks after the vineyards around Osoyoos (SF 3 & 20) and Rob looks after the vineyards in the Oliver area (SF 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 16, 17 & (15 - Naramata)).
I've also cc'd Jose.  He may have Chad's contact information and can forward it to you.
