Site info misc for Okanakan vineyards 

From Pat Bowen on 20 April 2020:

Re your message earlier on Arterra vineyards, all of their vineyards should be good for you, but if you need to pare down, I would certainly keep Dark Horse, because Mike's office is there and we have a weather station on site. Whitetail is bigger, a cooler site, and the higher elevation area is even cooler. They've had some winter freeze issues there in the past. McIntyre is similar to Whitetail. Inkameep is a great site, older vineyard. They should all be OK.
