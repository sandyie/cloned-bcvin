This folder is home to all of the climate projection scripts and related info. 

derivedfiles: The script that inspired inspired all of the functions scripts
functions: Contains the most up-to-date version of all the functions necessary for opening, aggregating, summarizing, and writing files.
functions_externaldrive: Same script as functions but changes the directories to read from the external drive. This was mostly to prevent destroying the original functions file.
functiontesting: Mostly just the functions.R file but has calls to the functions and comparisons to test if values are truly unique and if things are output correctly.
functiontesting_historical: had to rearrange the original functions to fit the historical folders output by ClimateBC. 
gatheringData: where all of the functions are called to open/aggregate/write the climate projections 
visualizations: location of map scripts and histogram calls
