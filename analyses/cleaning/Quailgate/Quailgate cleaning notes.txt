Here is a information on the Quailsgate data and list of the cleaning tasks that need doing for the data.

Files
-----

Viticulture Summary History (up to 2008)
* this is the summary of what wines were grown where, how much they prodcued and how much they cost
* this file needs a fair bit of cleaning because they layout is rather unhelpful. at the end of each 
  variety-vinyard section there is a "total" section which contains information on costsings 
* i think that we need a column for vinyard and teh "total" data needs removing and perhaps remerging 
  as another column in the main rows 
* this file also doesnt seem to have feild or block information, it only lists the vinyards 

VITICULTURE SUMMARY
* i put a more complete description of what i think is in this file in "ViticultureSummaryExplinationFJ.txt" 
  in the same directory
* this is a series of different data sheets on different tabs. 
* teh most useful one is probably "QGV Sum". This contains the year, feild, block, variety, age of stand,
  productivity, Brix, pH, TA,and cost of the crop
* In terms of cleaning, there are Total sections that need removing.  The data are also split into 
  vinyards, and these need a column making for them instead of excel subsections   
* the blks tab shpreadsheet might also be useful as it has data on what teh different blocks are, when 
  they were planted and how many vines 

Phenological Data Report 2012 - 2016
*  this file contains data on some phenological events such as budburst (Right after wooly bud stage),
   full bloom and lag phase. 
*  There is a column with location and sub location info, but it needs seperating out  
*  the phenology column needs cleaning a bit because sometimes there are commenst like "Around 5% winter 
   bud damage (primary bud) Riesling BudBreak April-20th B1, B2,B4" 
*  there is a lot of values like "E-L 24" in the phenology column - what do they mean?
*  the different subsections need removing so it is a single cohesive spreadsheet 
*  blank rows need removing 

PHENOLOGICAL_DATA_ed_MY
* phenological data for 2000 - 2012 including feild id, block, planting date, and columsn for different 
  phenological events. 
* this fiel has already undergone a bit of manual cleaning by Mika, but needs the different tabs for each 
  year combining and some rehsaping

/vinyardmaps/vinyardMapsDataCompiled_MY 
* information on what different blocks are, where they are and when they were planted, how big they are
* I think the "Date" column refers to the date that the map was from i.e. Feb 11 was an accurate depiction 
  of where the blocks where in spring 2011. 
* this data should be clean, it just needs merging into the Phenology and Climate data files 

nektar/qg_phenology2017_19
* I think this file is dates when various phenology events took place. I think the information on which 
  event the row refers to is in the "Stage" colun but it is numeric and I have not yet found the explination 
  for each code
* other than the code issue in the task column this data looks fairly clean  
* data from 2017-2019

2019May23_Full/2015 - Viticulture Summary
* this sheet is almost the same as the "QGV Sum" sheet in the VITICULTURE_SUMMERY excel file. Exept for a 
  few column name differences it shoudl be relativly streight forward to bind with the historical data 

2019May23_Full/2015 Initial Analysis
* I dont think this contains extra information, but I am not super sure. It seems to be working out how much 
  they are expecting, and hwo that compares to how much they grew? There is average Brix/pH/TA data as we
  alreay have that data elsewhere? Maybe the block codes and vinyard information coudl be useful? The Vinyards
  are described in code. 

2019May23_Full/2015 Vinyard Harvest Data
* this file contains multiple tabs, but in general seems to have data for 2013, 2014 and 2015
* 13-14-15 Tons - For each vinyard, block and variety, how many tuns and acres of winegrapes were harvested 
  In terms of cleaning, this spreadsheets needs the variety names filled in, and the "total" sections removed 
* 2014 T per Acre - this tabe contains some of the same info as "13-14-15 Tons", and also tons/acre for 2013 and 2014
* 2015 Harvest - thsi data contains harvest data Brix, pH, TA, YAN, GDD data for 2015, although it would need a fair bit 
  of cleaning in terms of filling gaps and removing total sections
* Printable Format - the most usable tab. it contains a list of the 2015 harvet data, including the varieties, blocks,
  vinyards, productivity and grape qualities  Brix, pH, TA, YAN, GDD data. This spreadsheet needs soem row values 
  filling in and teh total sections removed 

2019May23_Full/2016 Vinyard Harvest Data
* this is the same format of data as "2015 Vinyard Harvest Data", except for 2016. 
* the previous two year's yeild is shown in teh first tab of this file, so that teh growers can see how their crop are 
  doing in compariosn to previous years. 

2019May23_Full/2017 Initial Analysis and Pick Dates
* data on what happened to teh grapes after they were picked - what tanks they went in, what yeast they used and stuff.
  There are picking data data which might be useful if this isnt stored elsewhere 

2019May23_Full/2017 Analysis and Pick Dates
* this file contains replicates of tabs in other excel spreadsheets in this folder. In addition, there is yeild data 
  for 2018 grape varieties 


2019May23_Full/2018_Ferment info
* fermentation information for the 2018 grapes, like how much and what was added into the grape mix, and what tanks things were
  put in
