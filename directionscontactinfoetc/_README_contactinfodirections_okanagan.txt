DIRECTIONS:

Arterra (see PNG file): The address is 4856 Mariposa Rd but if you put it in a GPS it will take you somewhere north of Naramata. Off Road 11 ... if you search for the address he gave in Oliver it should work. 

Sebastian Farms is on Black Sage Rd NEXT TO OLIVER LANDFILL (use that for Google Maps, should match the below ...) 
- go towards Oliver, left on Tucelnuit Drive then road jogs funny... get on Black Sage Road. LEFT on Siblco Road (where landfill is) then it's on the RIGHT just BEFORE the landfill.


Quail's Gate .. from Summerland, you turn in on the RIGHT just a little before the main parking and go down (past sign for authorized personnel only).
