* detailed information on what varieties were grown where, how productive they were, how much they cost,
  and berry charecteristics like Brix and pH. TA stands for total acidity, and is another way of looking at 
  acidity. Instead of the ratio of acidic vs alkaline (pH), it looks at the acid by volume.
