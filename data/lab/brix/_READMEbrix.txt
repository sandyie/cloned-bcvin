On 23 Sep 2020 Geoff downloaded brix_working_Aug25.xlsx from Google Drive (this is an updated version of brix_working), downloaded brix_working_Sep11.xlsx, deleted brix_working.xlsx

On 23 Sep 2020 Geoff created brix_working_all.csv and added all data from the brix_working_Aug25 and brix_working_Sep11 to this csv.

The following standardizations were done: "NK'MIP" and " NKMIP" to "NKMIP", "McIntrye" to "McIntyre", "DarkHorse" to "Dark Horse", "Quails Gate" to "Quails Gate Estate"
