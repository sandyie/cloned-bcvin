- Try to use flagging that is not pink, orange, yellow
- Only have a sign if you want them to NOT touch your plants, otherwise, skip the sign
- RETURN the Inkameep key
- Hours: usually as early as 6am okay, leave by 3-4pm. Saturdays usually okay

- He had Tamara pull together data in January, just never sent.
- He says the data should 'all be taken with a grain of salt' as it's different observers different years etc. but data from 'their' vineyards should be good. Harvest data from NOT their vineyards he described as 'iffy.'
- Veraison is 50% (color/softness)
- bloom dates is 50%
- budbreak is 50% of plant open (he confirmed this means first leaf tissue visible (EL 4), it does NOT mean EL 5 â€” green tips)
