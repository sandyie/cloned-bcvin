We received maps of Arterra vinyards from Carl Bogandoff on the 22nd of April, 2020. There are four pdf maps, inkameep.pdf, Vincor_inniskillinDH2010.pdf, Vincor_McIntyre 06.pdf and Vincor_Whitetail 08.pdf. 

In his original email, Carl says:

"Here you go.  These maps were made several years ago and may need to be
updated.  I’ve cc’d Mike so he can let you & me know what changes need
to be made. I think bud break near Oliver and Osoyoos will begin in the
next day or two"
