We received maps of Arterra vinyards from Carl Bogandoff on the 22nd of April, 2020. There are four pdf maps, inkameep.pdf, Vincor_inniskillinDH2010.pdf, Vincor_McIntyre 06.pdf and Vincor_Whitetail 08.pdf. 

In his original email, Carl says:

"Here you go.  These maps were made several years ago and may need to be
updated.  I’ve cc’d Mike so he can let you & me know what changes need
to be made. I think bud break near Oliver and Osoyoos will begin in the
next day or two"  

From Carl Bogdanoff on 29 April 2020: Sent ArterraPhenologyVydlocations.PDF (was pptx)

See attached image.  For directions I would use an enlarged image from Google map.  I didn't quite get all of Dark Horse Vyd on the attached map (oops!). To get to Mike's office from Oiver head south on hwy 97 (4 km), turn right on Road 11, cross the small irrigation canal (0.3 km) then stay left on Mariposa Rd. (0.2 km) Mike's office - the old winery is just to the right.


Received on 5 May 2020 (email from Scott Carlson follows)

McIntyre has the Gew in D2 cut out. B and C and P planted P. Noir now. N is all Cab Franc.

Call if you need anything at anytime.
