I am an Associate Professor at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver (Canada) who works on shifts in viticulture with climate change. My team is about to start work on some new phenological models -- we'll be taking a suite of new approaches to see if we can improve precision and start work towards models that can be applied to finer spatial scales.

As we start this, we're trying to gather as much phenological data as possible. The major areas from which we have data will determine how successful the models are and where they can be best applied to. As such I wondered if your vineyard had any phenological data you may be willing to share. Data are most useful when they are for longer than 5 years (and ideally matched climate data, but the phenological data are the most critical).

If you may have data to share, please let me know and I can provide additional information. If you have any questions, please just let me know. 

All the best,
Lizzie
