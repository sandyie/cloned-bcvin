Blurb for Pat


I am interested in improved phenological models for a suite of winegrape varieties, with the long term goal to improve future matching of winegrape varieties to regional and local climates. Along with several other colleagues I have developed phenological models for 11 major winegrape varieties (see below) and would be interested in testing and adjusting our models for the Okanagan winegrowing region. 

Data needs: Dates of budburst (ideally green tips stage), flowering (ideally 50%), veraison (ideally 50%) and Brix (any matched sugar and date data) for the studied varieties. As we model each stage separately (but sequentially) any one part of these data needs helps. 

11 current varieties studied:
Cabernet-Sauvignon, Chasselas, Chardonnay, Grenache, Merlot, Monastrell (syn. Mourvedre), Pinot noir, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, Syrah and Ugni blanc

Note that we anonymize all data. Currently we are testing the models at a very large spatial scale, though we hope to work on down-scaling them next. I'd be happy to provide more details on the project and answer any questions.
