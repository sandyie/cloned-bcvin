Sebastian Farms variety codes Readme. Started May 2020 by Lizzie

Received from Pat Bowen on 16 May 2020

Hi Lizzie,  Attached is the list of varieties by vineyard, and their 2-letter codes. The vineyard blocks are coded with a vineyard number, variety code, then location letter. e.g. 02CHB is Chardonnay in vineyard 2 block B. The only variety codes we don't know for sure are GA (probably Gamay), AL (probably Albarino) and MB (probably Malbec).  For vineyards, MH is the same as SF. Hopefully this is what you need,

varietyDecoder.csv

A copy of Pat's spreadsheet that Mira Garner edited to add three letter variety codes from the brix data.

The two and three letter codes were matched using the location code explained in Pat's email above (column name: "CodesMatch"). The two letter codes were matched to the variety names using the phenology data which contain the location codes and written variety names (column name: 2codeNameMatch).

If multiple codes or variety names matched, this was recorded in the notes column.

For the unknown codes, we recorded which years they are found in the datasheets in the year column.

Hi Lizzie,

CB = Chenin Blanc
EH = Ehrenfelser
MO = Muscat Ottonel
MG = Moscato Giallo
BA = Barbera
SA = Sangiovese
GF = Gamay Feaux
GN = Gamay Noir

As for the rest I am not sure what varietals they are, could be typos.  If you provide the vineyard ID associated to the codes I might be able to decipher.

Cheers,
Victor

Hi Mira,

Iâ€™m not sure of these codes. They are definitely not our vineyards but could have been old grower contracts. Sorry I could not be as much help.

Cheers,

Victor

Hi Victor,

I found the following vineyard codes for the mystery varieties. For FOC, there were two different vineyard codes so I included the year each first appeared.

 
BC - SPEBCE
FOC - SPEMFA (2004), SPEFOA (2007)
FC - GSFCJ


Thanks for your help!

Cheers,
