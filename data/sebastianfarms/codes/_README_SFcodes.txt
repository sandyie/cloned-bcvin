Hi Lizzie,  Attached is the list of varieties by vineyard, and their 2-letter codes. The vineyard blocks are coded with a vineyard number, variety code, then location letter. e.g. 02CHB is Chardonnay in vineyard 2 block B. The only variety codes we don't know for sure are GA (probably Gamay), AL (probably Albarino) and MB (probably Malbec).  For vineyards, MH is the same as SF. Hopefully this is what you need,
