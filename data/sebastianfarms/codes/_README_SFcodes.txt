Hi Lizzie,  Attached is the list of varieties by vineyard, and their 2-letter codes. The vineyard blocks are coded with a vineyard number, variety code, then location letter. e.g. 02CHB is Chardonnay in vineyard 2 block B. The only variety codes we don't know for sure are GA (probably Gamay), AL (probably Albarino) and MB (probably Malbec).  For vineyards, MH is the same as SF. Hopefully this is what you need,

A copy of Pat's spreadsheet that Mira Garner edited to add three letter variety codes from the brix data.

The two and three letter codes were matched using the location code explained in Pat's email above (column name: "CodesMatch"). The two letter codes were matched to the variety names using the phenology data which contain the location codes and written variety names (column name: 2codeNameMatch).

If multiple codes or variety names matched, this was recorded in the notes column.

For the unknown codes, we recorded which years they are found in the datasheets in the year column.
