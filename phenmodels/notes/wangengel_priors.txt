Hi Lizzie, 

I propose to test
Tmin: 0-10 C  --> I propose to open the prior to 10°C because this threshold is usually used in the litterature
Tmax: 30-45 C --> I propose it because 30 is already a high "mean" temperature
Ok for Topt and F*

The system is able to manage when two parameters have priors that can be overlapped? 
All the best

Hi Iñaki,

Wait -- I also meant to cc you on an email to Mike with my suggested priors:

Tmin: 0-8 C (often fixed in models to 0)

Tmax: 35-45 C (most often fixed in models to 40)

Topt: 20-32 C (but most often 25-30 C)

Total Wang & Engel units for events vary but I have seen 10-100 as the usual range.

Let me know if you think any are very wrong, or have any thoughts.

All the best,
Lizzie
