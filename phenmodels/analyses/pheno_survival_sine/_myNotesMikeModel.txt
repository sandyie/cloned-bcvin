Running the model...

7:31
chains running at 1% by 7:37
some hit 2% at 7:39, 3% at 7:43
chain 1 at 37% by 7:50 (chain 4 still at 12%)
chain 1 at 49% by 7:52 (chain 4 still at 18%)
chain 4 at 28% by 7:53
chain 1 at 71% by 7:54
chain 1 done before 7:58
most done by 8:04

Model diagnostic: integrated_we_pred Rhat etc. is NaN  but shinystan says all is well!

Looking at the model code (12 July 2020)

Is gamma_tune.stan that magical thing that Mike does to help guess at priors semi-analytically?

fit_temp.stan ... How does temperature model handle years?

fit_pheno_survival_sine.stan questions!
	- why is log hazard in inverse days?
	- where does the 1.3862943 come from?
	- why a gamma? What is it doing? (see below)?

"One thing that Iâ€™ve learned so far is that the WE model is pretty non identified.
By changing the WE threshold (which sort of becomes gamma in my model)
and T_min, T_opt, and T_max in the right way you can explain the same 
transition time multiple ways.  The question is how much we can actually 
constrain those parameters scientifically to well-pose the model!"
