From Geoff:

Regarding the Sept 23 code, do you have an R script you're using to fit the model? The data block in splines_prior.stan differs from the one for the survival model and I'm not sure how Michael went about testing it. If I modify the data block, the model fits fine. Here's one way to do this:

dataspline <- list(N_obs = 100,
                   x = input_data$temp_rec[1:100],
                   N_knots = 5,
                   knots = seq(10, 90, length.out = 5))

fit <- stan(file='spline_prior.stan',
            data=dataspline,
            seed=19389932, chains = 4)


[I asked: what issues you found in his code, so maybe you're referring to that? Let me know what the issues were]

Sure. The sine model was slightly misspecified. In the original version, parameter temp_phase was allowed to exceed parameter temp_period. This can lead to multiple modes in the posterior because the phase represents the horizontal offset of the sine wave. When this offset is greater than the period, it's equivalent to an offset equal to offset - period. For example, if the period is 360, a phase of 1 or 361 lead to the same values. The minimum size of the period also cannot be less than the spacing of the temperature measurements (1 day). Fixing both these problems led to a sine model that behaves well for arbitrary inputs.

Running the model...

7:31
chains running at 1% by 7:37
some hit 2% at 7:39, 3% at 7:43
chain 1 at 37% by 7:50 (chain 4 still at 12%)
chain 1 at 49% by 7:52 (chain 4 still at 18%)
chain 4 at 28% by 7:53
chain 1 at 71% by 7:54
chain 1 done before 7:58
most done by 8:04

Model diagnostic: integrated_we_pred Rhat etc. is NaN  but shinystan says all is well!

Looking at the model code (12 July 2020)

Is gamma_tune.stan that magical thing that Mike does to help guess at priors semi-analytically?

fit_temp.stan ... How does temperature model handle years?

fit_pheno_survival_sine.stan questions!
	- why is log hazard in inverse days?
	- where does the 1.3862943 come from?
	- why a gamma? What is it doing? (see below)?

"One thing that Iâ€™ve learned so far is that the WE model is pretty non identified.
By changing the WE threshold (which sort of becomes gamma in my model)
and T_min, T_opt, and T_max in the right way you can explain the same 
transition time multiple ways.  The question is how much we can actually 
constrain those parameters scientifically to well-pose the model!"
