- Below, I wrote, as Carl has iteratively altered the models, I wonder if he knows whether some changes at all undo other changes? --> Are there any fairly easy, logical ways we could check this?

- Related to iterative changes in model, it would be good to test a simpler version of the model and see how poorly it actually performs (perhaps one simple enough that we could do LOO).

- Run a hierarchical model of the hardiness data including variety and vineyard (and year) as random effects.

- Fundamental query -- seems like the way to know what you should tweak is partly this way (what makes the equations work) and partly then you do experiments to see if your tweaks are right, has Carl done that? 
- As Carl has iteratively altered the models, I wonder if he knows whether some changes at all undo other changes?

Thanks for the updated files! I don't think I have yet run into the issues you flagged, but I am moving slowly (and not yet worrying about R squared etc.). I did notice a small error in cell CD23 -- it says the statement changes on 7 Jan, but it also changes on 8 Dec (as the Word file suggests and as the Excel formulas show). But really, between the Word doc and notes in Excel (and my slow pace) I have not had many queries.

But, since you're writing -- do you know how you imputed missing days of weather data? I noticed our estimates are off a little when the daily temp data are missing so I imagine we're using different methods (I am just taking the mean of the surrounding dates).

As for issues with the model - I'm sure there are more.  Back many years ago I used to be sharper and was able to keep track of many changes, all at once!  Oh well ....

Missing Penticton weather data was usually filled in with Env Canada Summerland weather data.  You might already have this, but if not, attached is the weather data I used. (ATTACHED: 2012-2018 PENTICTON WEATHER EM.xslx)

Note that more vigorous vines are often a little less hardy.
Crop load has little impact unless vines are stressed (delayed maturity delays hardiness).
There's also high variability in the lethal temps, even for one site on one day. 

(a) Missing site column for hardiness data for 2016-2019 (though I do have 2018-2019!) 
-> He can send me the list if I email him and remind him.

(b) Method for GDD (I have not re-created)
	b1) What is basetemp?
        b2) Is it until September 20th or October 15th?

-> It's calculated as ((daily max + min)/2) - 10
-> Accumulated 1 Apr to 30 October 
-> From Carl's 'GDD_email.pdf' ... For GDD numbers, I used Brad's already published GDD from Summerland (see attached GDD_2018_Oct_Final). I was lazy and probably should have used Env Canada's Penticton weather data. I've now just calculated Penticton's GDD data (also attached) and of course it is different averaging 80 GDD/season less than Summerland's. This discrepancy is likely due to Penticton having cooler minimum temperatures - the Summerland site is here at the station while Penticton's on the valley bottom at the airport.
If I use Penticton's GDD in the model and modify my GDD multipliers the model results are not quite as good (see .xlsx file tab: Env Canada Penticton GDD, columns Y to AI).

(c) How do you ever get the equations started?

IMPT columns are AV-BJ  -> Need hardiness value for same date each year. Red ones are guesses made by Carl (based on empirical hardiness data). Black ones are empirical data. Then you take the average (e.g., BZ for 10 Nov is 19.4 is the average of the guesses + one black). Same story for the numbers above and below ... guesses are missing when there is no previous empirical data. *THESE data are what are in the curves** so there is no circularity (unlike I thought). 

(d) Should I not start doing accumulation until 15 September (email) or 21 September (paper)?
Some start 21 September for LTE estimates (15 Sept for historical climate)

(e) Max and min daily changes in LTE only happens in certain windows ... so some periods have no max or min daily change? Or DO *all* periods have a min change (see assumption 5 in 8c about 10C)? And *Second* assumption 5 also!
	- Max of 0.5 is Oct 9 to Oct 17 and from March 31 to April 11
	- Min of 0.1 is Dec 8 to Feb 6 (or is it 0.1 always, see 10a)
	- Something from Nov 29 to Dec 7 (the estimated LTE/day is -0.1)	
	- Oct 24 - Apr 2 -- Need help with second assumption 5 

8c: Is written wrong in Word doc. It should be decrease once historical 2-day average temp is 10C (which is on 8 or 9 October)

(f) Is the 0.5 max a abs(0.5) or -0.5 or +0.5? 
-> It's both -- it's -0.5 (getting more cold hardy) during acclimation and +0.5 (getting less cold hardy) during de-acclimation. 

Actual multiplier is dependent on whether the day was colder or warmer than average. 
Column DR (and similar, labelled 'Estimated LTE/day) is maximum additional LTE gained that day. 
So curves predict change in LTE per day not absolute LTE per day!
`LTE actual' is mean across years. 

17 Oct is when acclimation curve (with equation) is first used!

15 Sept - 15 Oct is semi-random polynomial ... none of the shown equations are used here (Carl said it would be in some other spreadsheet and is semi-irrelevant). Not sure how much this info matters (before 15 Oct). Hard to estimate before mid to late October as the peaks in LTE machine are hard to read for most places and buds then (because of free water). 

When Max hardiness starts (8 Dec) then you also switch from -0.1 to +0.1


<><><><><><><><>
<> NEXT STEPS <>
<><><><><><><><>
- See if it works in Ontario. Or New York ... Repeat same process there (need historical climate data and hardiness data). Or Washington -- Carl has their data (collect from one site with 20 varieties .... 4 varieties per day so staggering across days). 
- Predicting which sites are cooler/warmer and what it means for hardiness. (iButton data collected but not currently looking at it.) ... Look at predicted LTE by site and see which are high/low?

<> in the order I had them  <>
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><> 
Word file and word doc refer 'Chardonnay Hardiness Model Instructions for v16.docx'

- Three major curves used are in BQ-BS columns (overlapping dates, see Assumption 2 in word doc) 
`estimated actual LTE50' x historical daily T mean
(a) For 15 Oct to 7 Dec (polynomial) -- acclimation
(b) For 24 Nov to 15 Feb (linear) -- max hardiness
(c) 1 Feb to 30 March (polynomial) -- de-acclimation
... data are in BY and BZ columns
One of these columns is easy ... it's the 2day Mean C from the historical data. But where does the LTE50 come from? It's not the mean ... of LTE50 from earliest date of Chardonnay 

WAIT! It's the predicted LTE (column DJ ... for one year). So, how do you ever get the equation in the first place?

- Column CB is where Carl first calculates the predicted LTE50 from the three equations ... but not sure how he spliced the curves together (maybe for just overlapping dates you do this: They are spliced together where curves intersect by averaging LTE values just above and just below the intersection point)

From Carl on 9 July 2019:

Column CB is simply the daily difference in Estimated LTE (ie.  CA89-CA88).  There are  however 3 big assumptions that affect the values in column CB.
1)  I arbitrarily set the maximum daily change in LTE to 0.5.  This value is used from Oct 9 to Oct 17 and from March 31 to April 11.
2)  I also set the minimum daily change in LTE to 0.1 which occurs slightly before, slightly after and during the period of Maximum Hardiness Nov 29 to Feb 22.  (Note:  the actual period of Maximum Hardiness and the associated IF & IF(AND statements is from Dec 8 to Feb 6.  From Nov 29 to Dec 7 the estimated LTE/day is -0.1 with this value used with the IF & IF(AND statements used during the Hardiness Acclimation period.)
3)  From Sep 15 to Oct 8 the Estimated LTE/day value is a guess!!!  I have no hardiness data for this period of time, but I make the assumption that buds begin to accumulate hardiness by the middle of September.
