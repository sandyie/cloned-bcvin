oldCarlModel/
Files in this folder peratin to an old verion of Carl's model that Faith coded up. 
	These R files contain longwinded loops to replicate Carl's excel spreadsheet model 
	ColumnCC_function.R
	ColumnCE_function.R
	ColumnCF_function.R
	ColumnCG_function.R - thsi one does the rest of the columns as well in one giant loop 

	hardiness_stab.r 
	This script replicates Carl's spreadshee, and needs the Column_function.R scripts to run

LinearModelHardiness_slopes.R
Here I am trying to model hardiness as a linear process of temperature. There is a mix of simulating data, running models in stanrarm, predictive checks and stan models. Still a work in process

LinearModelHardiness_slopes_sim.R
Here I am running the linear hardiness model, but using simulated data. 

LinearModelHardiness_slopes_quad.R
This model is similar to the LinearModelHardiness model, but contains a quadratic element. 

LinearModelHardiness_slopes_sim_quad.R
The same as the quadratic model exept using simulated rather than real data.  

simulatingFerguson_stab.R 
Here i simulated data based on teh parameters provided by ferguson et al 2011. I also 
wrote and ran a STAN model. but as yet it is not predicting the parameters very well. 
I scraped the temperature data from one of their plots. 

simulatingFerguson_therData.R
I got access to the temperature and hardiness data of Chardonay, and the updated model
parameters from Ferguson etal 2014. I am not trying to simulate data from these, and then build
a model that predicts them.
