It’s Saturday afternoon and it’s very windy and cold outside.  So instead of working in the garden I thought I’d tinker with the Merlot and Chardonnay hardiness models.  They are both attached.  These latest versions now have all of the 2019 – 2020 winter data included.  It’s unfortunate that I was not allowed to get any of this week’s bud hardiness measurements, having those early and late season hardiness values are important!
