Location for all scripts and files regarding the hardiness dashboard project. 

mainDashboard.R - references other R scripts and calls Carl's 2020 model & scrapes data (as of now, should probably offload this to a different script location)
testingIdeas.R - just putting my thoughts into a script without context. The contents are scattered in different scripts.
veryfingModel.R - good starting place when trying to look at the how closely the R model resembles Carl's model.
moreFunctions.R - a supplemental home for functions that are used in mainDashboard.R. Extension of "helfulFunctions.R" that is directly referenced in the Carl May 2020 scripts
